            Constructors that may be used with a single parameter should be
            explicit unless silent type conversion is desired. If silent type
            conversion is desired, non-explicit constructor declaration should
            have a comment about the conversion.
        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='c2' />

            All non-static class data members must be initialized [in all
            class constructors]. You may skip data members that have
            reasonable default constructors.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='p1' />

            Make pointers nil after delete unless they clearly go out of scope
            right after delete. For example, pointer deletions in small and
            simple destructors are excepted.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='p2' />

            Do not check pointers for nil before deleting them. C++ does that
            for you.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='p3' />

            Use (foo) and (!foo) instead of (foo != 0) and (foo == 0)
            when testing pointers for being nil.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='b1' />

            Use (foo) and (!foo) instead of (foo == true), (foo == false), and
            such when testing boolean expressions for being true/false.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='v1' />

            Avoid multiple virtual methods with identical names. Correctly
            overriding them is error-prone.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='patch1' />

            Use unified patch with at least 20 lines of context (-U 20).

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='patch2' />

            Use --show-c-function or equivalent where supported.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='patch3' />

            A patch should not have whitespace-only changes unless they are
            intentional and in patch scope.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='patch4' />

            A patch should not have changes that only add or remove empty
            lines.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s1' />

            Use camelCaseNames when the code around your changes uses
            such names. Avoid adding names_with_underscores in that case.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s2' />

            Use names_with_underscores when the code around your changes uses
            such names. Avoid camelCase names in that case.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s2p1' />

            Do not prefix variable and data member names with their types
            (a.k.a. Hungarian notation altnough the original approach under
            that name was <a
            href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html">reportedly</a>
            misunderstood and misused). Anyway, just name the thing; its type
            may change and is rarely critical for its purpose.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s3' />

            Avoid adding {} for single-line statements like

            <pre class="code">
                if (foo) {
                    bar();
                }
            </pre>

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s4' />

            Order class sections as such: public, protected, and private.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s5' />

            Within each public/protected/private section, declare methods
            before data members.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s6' />

            Within each public/protected/private section, declare static
            members before non-static ones.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s7' />

            Use const when you can.

        </div>
        <div>
            <input type='checkbox' id='s8' />

            Declare local variables as close to their first use, including
            inside if-statement conditions when possible: if (const char *foo = ...).

        </div>

        <p>This is an experimental interface. The interface itself and
        even the issue IDs may change.</p>
